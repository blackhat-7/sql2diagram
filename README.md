# SQL2D2


## How it works
- Parse the SQL statement to get
    - Tables
    - Columns
    - Constraints
    - PK, FK

- Map the constaints with the available tables to get the connections
- General D2 for each table filled with columns and PK, FK marked
- Draw connections between tables using constaints
